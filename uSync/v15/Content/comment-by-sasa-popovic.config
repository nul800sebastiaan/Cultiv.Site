      <Value><![CDATA[@Sebastiaan A very good article! You are right; we felt the same as you when we decided to build uSiteBuilder. We use it for more than a year now and our productivity has increased dramatically. Two things that I personally like the most are extremely easy collaboration in larger teams and how it is easy to make updates in a website after you didn’t work on it for a few months.<br /><br />@Niels I remember you mentioned that you find LGPL very complicated but I really can’t think of any limitations of LGPL that would affect people who use uSiteBuilder; could it be that you were thinking about the GPL license? The GPL is much more restrictive and complicated in my opinion. You can check this nice and simple comparison of licenses (both LGPL and MIT are there): http://developer.kde.org/documentation/licensing/licenses_summary.html. There are a number of open source projects out there that we use in every day work that are licensed under LGPL; some of the most popular ones are TinyMCE, NHibernate, etc but there are much more that are not so popular.<br /><br />@Everyone But still, if we overlooked real showstoppers in LGPL we will certainly think again and reconsider our decisions. We already accepted Niels’ remarks just after the launch of uSiteBuilder and switched from closed source to LGPL. Feel free to send us your feedback on the licensing model as you continue to use uSiteBuilder.<br />]]></Value>
