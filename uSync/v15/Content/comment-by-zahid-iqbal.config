      <Value><![CDATA[Great, Great, Great, Great !!!!!!!<br /><br />Many a thanks  friend. Although I had been working with CMS's and consider myself an advanced user :S<br />But umbraco gave me a headache in the start and was treating me a child and didn't let me know whats happening behind the scenes, whereas I need a total control ! <br />where ever I wanted to see the starting guide, the only thing mentioned was how to change the skin :P<br /><br />but great work dude, thumbs up]]></Value>
