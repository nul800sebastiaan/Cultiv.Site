      <Value><![CDATA[Bit more feedback.......<br />Don&#39;t know if you can do anything about this but my GIT client doesn&#39;t pick up changes relating to the addition of plugins.  i.e. when I installed Archetype and it&#39;s Courier.dll, I had to show untracked files and select them. As you won&#39;t necessarily know what files to include, is it possible to modify the .gitignore file to be able to pick these changes up. In this case it was additions to the /bin and /App_Plugins directories.]]></Value>
