      <Value><![CDATA[Thanks for this Sebastiaan!<br /><br />I&#39;m currently following advice from the UaaS docs that states:<br /><br />&quot;The easiest way is to simply open the cloned project folder as a Web Site in VS. This approach is great if you are working alone or in a small team and you are comfortable with having your c# code in the /App_Code/ and /App_Plugins/ folders. By doing this there is literally nothing to set up. All you have to do is open the folder and you can run the site locally by pressing Ctrl-F5.&quot;<br /><br />This has been working well and removed the need for a seperate source project/repo. Are there major benefits from a separate source project? Or potential risks/performance issues running from App_Code?]]></Value>
